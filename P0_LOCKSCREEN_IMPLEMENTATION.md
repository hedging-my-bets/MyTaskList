# P0 Lock Screen Interactive Widget Implementation

## Overview
This PR implements the complete P0 requirements for the PetProgress Lock Screen interactive widget, enabling users to view pet evolution progress and manage tasks directly from the Lock Screen.

## ✅ P0 Features Completed

### 1. Lock Screen Widget + Pet Evolution Display
- ✅ Converted widget to `AppIntentConfiguration` for iOS 17+ interactivity
- ✅ Added `ConfigurationAppIntent` for widget configuration
- ✅ Updated provider to `AppIntentTimelineProvider`
- ✅ Added proper `AccessoryWidgetBackground()` for Lock Screen families
- ✅ Supports `.accessoryRectangular` (primary) and `.accessoryCircular`

### 2. Nearest-Hour Timeline Alignment
- ✅ Implemented top-of-hour timeline building with 12-hour lookahead
- ✅ Used `Calendar.nextDate()` for precise hour alignment
- ✅ Added `loadDayModelForDate()` to materialize tasks for future hours
- ✅ Widget content auto-updates at each hour boundary

### 3. Mark Done from Lock Screen (App Intent)
- ✅ Enhanced existing `CompleteTaskIntent` to work from Lock Screen
- ✅ Wired to interactive Button in rectangular widget
- ✅ Updates App Group state via `SharedStore.updateTaskCompletion()`
- ✅ Triggers immediate widget refresh with `WidgetCenter.shared.reloadAllTimelines()`

### 4. Next/Prev/Skip from Lock Screen
- ✅ Added `ShowNextTaskIntent` and `ShowPreviousTaskIntent`
- ✅ Implemented shared widget focus index using App Group `UserDefaults`
- ✅ Enhanced `SkipTaskIntent` with proper task tracking
- ✅ Dense 4-button layout: Prev (◀), Next (▶), Complete (✅), Skip (✖)

### 5. iPhone-Only Targeting
- ✅ Explicit `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY: "1"` for all targets (App, Widget, Tests)
- ✅ Eliminates iPad icon warnings during build
- ✅ App offered only on iPhone in App Store Connect

### 6. Privacy Policy Link in Settings
- ✅ Already implemented with working Safari view integration
- ✅ Opens external privacy policy URL in SFSafariViewController
- ✅ Accessible from Settings → Privacy → Privacy Policy

### 7. CI Simulator Destination
- ✅ Already robust with concrete iPhone 15 simulator creation
- ✅ Uses newest iOS runtime with proper error handling
- ✅ More reliable than generic simulator destinations

## 🎯 Lock Screen Widget Layout

**Rectangular (.accessoryRectangular):**
```
Stage 3                    45 XP
Focus work                 14:00
◀  ▶              ✅  ✖
```

**Circular (.accessoryCircular):**
```
   ●●●●○○○
  ●         ○
 ●     3     ○
  ●         ○
   ●●●●○○○
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### App Intent Architecture
- **CompleteTaskIntent**: Marks current/next task as done, awards XP
- **SkipTaskIntent**: Advances past current task without completion
- **ShowNextTaskIntent**: Cycles to next available task in current hour
- **ShowPreviousTaskIntent**: Returns to previous task with bounds checking

### Timeline Provider
- Builds entries aligned to hour boundaries (`Calendar.nextDate()`)
- 12-hour lookahead ensures smooth hourly transitions
- Materializes day models for future dates using `TimeSlot.dayKey()`
- Immediate refresh after task state changes

### Persistence Layer
- App Group shared `UserDefaults` for widget focus index
- `SharedStore` handles task completion with atomic operations
- Widget-app sync via `WidgetCenter.reloadAllTimelines()`

## 🧪 Acceptance Criteria Verification

| Criteria | Status | Implementation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Widget appears in Lock Screen add sheet | ✅ | AppIntentConfiguration + supported families |
| Shows correct pet stage and hour's task | ✅ | PetEvolutionEngine + nearest-hour filtering |
| Interactive buttons work on Lock Screen | ✅ | Button(intent:) with working App Intents |
| Hourly content updates automatically | ✅ | Timeline policy: .after(nextHour) |
| Task completion persists across app/widget | ✅ | App Group SharedStore integration |
| Next/Prev cycles tasks for current hour | ✅ | Shared focus index + task filtering |
| iPhone-only targeting (no iPad warnings) | ✅ | TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY: "1" all targets |

## 🚀 Ready for App Store

This implementation provides a fully functional Lock Screen widget that meets all P0 requirements for v1.0 App Store submission:

- **Interactive Lock Screen experience** - Users can manage tasks without opening the app
- **Pet evolution visibility** - Lock Screen shows current pet stage and progress
- **Hourly task alignment** - Always shows the most relevant upcoming task
- **Robust persistence** - App Group ensures data consistency between app and widget
- **iPhone-focused experience** - Clean build with no iPad warnings

The widget provides essential task management functionality directly from the Lock Screen while maintaining the pet progression gamification that makes the app engaging.
