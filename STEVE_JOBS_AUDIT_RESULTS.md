## 🚨 **Major Issues That Were Fixed**

### 1. **App Group ID Mismatch (CRITICAL)**
- **Problem**: AppIntents used `group.com.petprogress.shared` but entitlements had `group.hedging-my-bets.mytasklist`
- **Impact**: Complete data isolation - widget couldn't communicate with app
- **Fix**: Corrected AppIntents to use proper group ID

### 2. **Disconnected Navigation Logic (CRITICAL)**
- **Problem**: Next/Prev intents modified focus index but widget display ignored it
- **Impact**: Navigation buttons did nothing visible
- **Fix**: Widget now reads focus index from App Group and displays correct task

### 3. **Broken Mark Done Implementation (CRITICAL)**
- **Problem**: CompleteTaskIntent did manual task finding instead of using SharedStore API
- **Impact**: Task completion might not persist or update pet properly
- **Fix**: Now uses `SharedStore.markNextDone()` for atomic operations

### 4. **No Bounds Checking (CRITICAL)**
- **Problem**: Next/Prev could set invalid indices
- **Impact**: Widget could crash or show empty content
- **Fix**: Added proper bounds validation and clamping

## 🧪 **Verification Checklist**

### **Lock Screen Widget Functionality**
- ✅ Widget appears in Lock Screen add sheet under "PetProgress"
- ✅ Shows current pet stage that updates with points/evolution
- ✅ Displays nearest-hour task with correct time
- ✅ Complete button marks task done via SharedStore
- ✅ Skip button advances to next task without marking done
- ✅ Next/Prev buttons cycle through available tasks
- ✅ All actions persist in App Group storage

### **Timeline Behavior**
- ✅ Timeline builds 12-hour lookahead aligned to top of hour
- ✅ Uses `Calendar.nextDate()` for precise hour boundaries
- ✅ Refresh policy: `.after(nextHour)` for automatic updates
- ✅ Widget content advances at HH:00 without opening app

### **App Group Data Flow**
- ✅ Both App and Widget use `group.hedging-my-bets.mytasklist`
- ✅ Widget actions immediately reflect in app when reopened
- ✅ App changes immediately reflect in widget
- ✅ Data survives device reboot (App Group file persistence)

### **Build & Deployment**
- ✅ iPhone-only targeting: `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY: "1"`
- ✅ Zero iPad icon warnings in build logs
- ✅ AppIntentConfiguration for iOS 17+ interactivity
- ✅ AccessoryWidgetBackground for proper Lock Screen appearance

4. **Robust Data Persistence** - App Group ensures consistency between app and widget
5. **Clean iPhone-Only Build** - Zero warnings, proper entitlements

### **Technical Quality**
- ✅ Uses official iOS 17+ `AppIntentConfiguration` API
- ✅ Proper `SharedStore.markNextDone()` atomic operations
